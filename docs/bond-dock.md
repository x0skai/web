# Bond Dock

The Dock shows two identities and which of them is at the wheel: the Bond, and
the Avaia that Bond owns. The one driving sits on the left, the one spectating
sits on the right, and the pair swaps when the wheel changes hands. Nothing here
writes shared-world state — the wheel is presentation, and the link between the
two identities stays the honest em dash until a Relationship projection exists.

## What each side does

**Left — the identity at the wheel.** Activating it brings the world to that
identity: the camera moves to the closest scale the map policy allows, over
where that identity's body stands. For the Bond that is the observation the
host already provides; for an Avaia that walked off it is where the Avaia is
now, never its Bond's position. A camera centred on a coordinate is
presentation, never evidence of presence, and with no observation there is
nothing to focus, so the control is inert rather than misleading.

**Right — the identity spectating.** Activating it hands the wheel over. The two
swap seats, the body leaving settles and the body arriving comes out onto the
world, and the camera comes in far enough to see that happen — the scale a body
is drawn from, or wherever the person already was if that is closer.

The wheel changes hands whatever this device can run. Taking it decides which
body the world draws, and a device that can load no model is still a device its
owner watches the world from. Where a runtime could be fetched and this host can
fetch one, taking the wheel is also what asks for it: one gesture, and what a
device fetches to serve it is not a second decision.

The Bond reads "You" while it drives and "spectate" while its Avaia does. That
is what spectating means here: watching a world someone else is moving through.

The world opens with the Avaia at the wheel and the Bond spectating. Opening
there is presentation only: nothing is fetched until a person hands the Avaia
the wheel with a gesture of their own. An Avaia at the wheel walks where its
owner taps and goes to see what its owner walked past — see
[Avaia walks the world](avaia-walk.md).

## Avaia availability

The right-hand Avaia states what this device can do about its runtime:

```text
ready        the runtime is loaded and can take the wheel
preparing    the runtime is being fetched or warmed up
download     this device can fetch it, and activating the Dock starts that
unavailable  there is nothing to download, or this device cannot run it
```

No Avaia runtime is published yet, so every host answers `unavailable` — which
is the truth rather than a placeholder: there is nothing to fetch. The other
states exist so the Dock already knows how to say what it will be able to say,
and a host that cannot fetch a runtime never offers a download it could not
perform. WebLLM support is a device capability, not a preference: a device
without accelerated graphics reports `unavailable` even once a runtime exists.

## Configuration on the card

Configuration and runtime are read apart. The role beside the Avaia's address
says `unconfigured` when that is what the identity service stored, whatever this
device could run, and an Avaia that was configured stays configured on a device
that can run nothing; the status dot keeps stating the runtime, because that is
what a dot about a runtime is for.

A client whose identity service has not reached contract 8 reads no profile at
all, states no configuration, and keeps exactly the Dock described above.

## Navigation

The Dock's header carries one `edit` action, and it configures the identity
currently selected on the left. With the Bond at the wheel it opens the Bond
edit surface at `/identity`; with the Avaia at the wheel it opens
[Avaia setup](avaia-setup.md). Configuration state may change the accessible
name to **Set up** while nothing has been configured or **Edit** otherwise, but
it never changes which identity the action targets. Its accessible name includes
the identity it would configure rather than exposing a bare "edit" to assistive
technology.

Configuring is not driving: opening it changes no seat and moves no camera.

The Bond address in the app header remains the identity affordance and remains a
real link, so the Bond profile is reachable whoever is driving, and the Dock's
pair stays what it should be — the world's focus control and the wheel, not a
second way to read a profile.

## One window, two screens

A screen change inside the Dock is a from-to pair rather than a replacement. The
screen being left and the screen being entered are both on the surface for the
length of the move: forward arrives from the trailing edge while the previous
screen recedes, back reverses exactly that, and the window travels between the
two heights, so the Dock grows or shrinks into its next screen instead of
jumping to it. It is the platform idiom iOS made familiar, which is the point —
a person reads the direction before they read the screen.

Direction is told, never guessed from a screen's name. The window is given the
screen it presents and how deep that screen sits; deeper is forward, shallower
is back. The stack is three deep: the world, a Bond surface, and a screen that
surface opens.

The screen being left is `aria-hidden` and `inert` while it leaves, so it is out
of reach of both a pointer and assistive technology. Two cases arrive settled
with no move at all: a window with no measurable layout — a test environment, or
a Dock that is not being painted — and a person who asked for reduced motion.
Nothing in the move touches the persistent world; the map is never animated or
remounted by a Dock navigation, and no view transition is taken over the
document to achieve it.

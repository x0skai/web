# Progression

A Bond and its Avaia level up by playing: revealing fog, studying what the
Avaia notices along the way, and a few one-time achievements. The activity
experience that pays for it is `pub_info` on the Bond's `.bnd`: synced, and
readable with the public Bond. Core is not asked to price it.

## Two earners

The Bond and its Avaia keep separate experience. What the owner did
themselves pays the Bond; what the Avaia did pays the Avaia.

| Action                                    | Who earns it | Reward |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | -----: |
| A zone (fog cell) revealed by the Avaia   | the Avaia    |      n |
| A zone (fog cell) walked open             | the Bond     |     3n |
| A monument studied, full description kept | the Avaia    |   4.5n |
| A monument noticed in passing             | the Bond     |     2n |

`n` is `EXPERIENCE_UNIT` in `progression.ts`, currently `10`. Walking a zone
open yourself costs more effort than sending the Avaia, so it pays more; the
Avaia's own study is the one that keeps the archive's full description, so it
pays more than a passing notice. How a zone opens and how a landmark gets
noticed or studied are [Avaia walks the world](avaia-walk.md)'s own; this file
only prices what already happens there.

## Achievements

An achievement pays once. Where "once" is counted depends on what it is about:

| Achievement            | Counted          | Bond | Avaia |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---: | ----: |
| Avaia configured       | once per account |   20 |     — |
| Avaia model downloaded | once per device  |   50 |   100 |

**Avaia configured** is read from what the identity service already keeps:
an Avaia whose stored state is `configured` has earned it, on every device
that reads it, and none of them has to remember having paid it. It is also
what takes the Avaia to level 1. The device that saves the setup says so in a
dialog — see [Avaia setup](avaia-setup.md).

**Avaia model downloaded** is something this device did for this Bond, so the
web, Telegram and Discord hosts each earn it on their own. It pays the moment
Settings finds the on-device model present — downloaded there with "Download
now", or already cached. Until then, once the Avaia is configured, a blue dot
marks the way: on the control that reaches Settings (the overflow `•••` on a
narrow screen, the gear or `/settings` on wider ones) until Settings has been
opened, and on "Download now" until the model is here. Blue because red
already means something failed and amber already means a runtime is working;
this is neither, only an invitation.

## Levels

The two curves are deliberately different.

**The Avaia climbs linearly.** Level 1 is being configured. After that every
150 experience is a level, with no ceiling: level 2 at 150, level 3 at 300,
level 100 at 14,850. A level in the hundreds is ordinary. Experience an
unconfigured Avaia earns is kept and counts once it is configured.

**The Bond climbs steeply.** Level `L` costs `50 · L³` in total: 50, 400,
1,350, 3,200, 6,250… Level 1 is one or two actions away — configuring the
Avaia and walking one zone open, say — while level 4 already takes a hundred
zones walked open.

## Where it lives

Activity experience is part of `pub_info`, the public slice of a Bond's
[`.bnd`](bnd-file-lifecycle.md). There is one total per Bond and one per its
Avaia. The identity service stores them and answers them with the public Bond,
so every host — the web, Telegram, Discord, and anyone opening the public
address — reads the same standing. Publishing is
`GET`/`POST /api/v1/identity/pub-info`. The public projection nests the same
totals under `pub_info.experience`.

A device still remembers what it has not managed to publish yet, under
`nilx-one.progression.v3.<owner>`. An award is an opaque `xp:` nonce plus an
amount. The nonce is how a retry stays idempotent; it is not a cell, a
landmark, or any other place, and it is not part of the public projection.
Only the totals are. Version 2 (`nilx-one.progression.v2.<owner>`) and version
1 (`nilx-one.progression.v1.<owner>`, less the configuration reward it used to
pay) are offered once as carry: the service keeps the greatest such baseline
and does not add it again. Experience earned after that is the event log, so
two devices playing at once both count.

The **Avaia model downloaded** achievement stays on the device that downloaded
it. It is added to that device's own standing and is not part of `pub_info`.

A level is still not a protocol fact: it creates no Interaction and completes
no BondChain. The service stores the totals the client publishes; it does not
price an action or derive a level. Fog reveals and the landmark notebook stay
on the device. What left the device is the experience those actions paid.

## What this is not

This is not a badge shop or a quest system. It is not evidence of presence or
attendance, and it asserts nothing about any Bond. The published totals say
how much was earned, not where. Losing local storage loses the device
achievement and any award that had not reached `pub_info` yet; the shared
totals remain.

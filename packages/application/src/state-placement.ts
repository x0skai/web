 * Where each piece of persisted state lives today.
 *
 * `placement` is the residence of the bytes, and it agrees with `medium`.
 * A record in local storage is never `server`: the service does not hold it,
 * and calling it server state would invent an authority the identity contract
 * has not given it.
 *
 * - `server` — an identity-service table. The `pub_dress`, everything a
 *   sign-in needs, and the named study stored as `identities.avatar_model`.
 * - `device` — resident on this device. It does not travel: the on-device
 *   model and its download, the journal key, work in flight, and an outfit
 *   the identity contract has no field for.
 * - `synchronizable` — also resident on this device today. The word names
 *   transport eligibility, not a third store and not a fact of having synced.
 *   Synchronizable is not shared state, not protocol state, and not synced
 *   state. Nothing in this placement leaves the device until a later slice
 *   carries it device to device, end to end, with the service at most a blind
 *   relay.
 *
 * `mobility` says what that eligibility is. `transport` is an interface
 * preference or a play record a Bond may one day find on its other device.
 * `sealed-transport` is a different class: BondChain copies and the presence
 * journal, which already have their own lifecycle and move only under it.
 * They are not the same kind of thing as a chosen language.
 *
 * The architecture test reads this table against real `setItem` call sites,
 * so a key the client writes and nobody placed fails the build.
